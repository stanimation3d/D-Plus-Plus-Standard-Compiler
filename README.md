# D++ (D Plus Plus)
D++ (D Plus Plus) is a programming language developed by Sahne Dünya, based on D but with more features added. The reason for the development of this programming language was to be largely compatible with the D programming language, so that it could benefit from applications using D programming languages ​​and developers could benefit from the modern features offered by D++. Although the D programming language is not widely known, it is actually a C/C++ alternative. Although the D programming language is not widespread, the same may not be true for D++. It may be one of the most important languages ​​in the history of system programming, who knows. However, I definitely need your support. Although the Standard Compiler of the D++ Programming Language initially targets RISC-V, it can support multiple platforms with your support in the future.

# Basic Feture
1. File extension: Source file: .d++ (I know you normally expect a .dpp extension, but since it is used in a field, we chose the .d++ extension as the most logical option)
2. Target Platform: Cross Platform
3. Based programming language: D
4. Compiler infrastructure: LLVM
5. Programming language used in software development: C++
6. Control structures: match (Pattern Matching)
7. Memory management: ownership and borrowing
8. Mainly supported programming: Object-oriented (OOP)
